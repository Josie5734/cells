# 20 Cells

---

This is a small Pico-8 application I made over a few days

It can be played [on the Web here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=153545) on the Lexaloffle BBS site, or you can run it locally either by downloading the files / p8.png cart to load into Pico-8, or downloading the .bin folder to play as a standalone program (supports linux, mac and windows)

20 Cells is an interactive recreation of a gif I saw of Rule 30 cellular automata on the Cellular Automata Wikipedia page

As the name suggests, there are only 20 cells in this one due to the width of the Pico-8 screen. There probably could be 30 but I prefer the slightly bigger cell size
